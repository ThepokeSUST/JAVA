    // java is statically typed and also strongly typed language ...

    // statically typed...........
    // A statically typed lamguage is a language where the type of variables are
    // known a compile time rather than run time.This meanns that the programmer
    // must declare the types of their data explicitly in their code...

    // strongly typed..............
    // A strongly typed programming language is a language that strictly defines the
    // type of each variable and value during compilation. This means that the
    // compiler can detect errors related to incorrect variable types during
    // compilation and execution.

    // Java has two categories in which data types are segregated.............

    // primitive data type in java
    // Primitive data are only single values and have no special capabilities. There
    // are 8 primitive data types.
    // boolean 8bits true->false default = false
    /*
     * The boolean data type represents a logical value that can be either true or
     * false. Conceptually, it represents a single bit of information, but the
     * actual size used by the virtual machine is implementation-dependent and
     * typically at least one byte (eight bits) in practice. Values of the boolean
     * type are not implicitly or explicitly converted to any other type using
     * casts.
