    /*
     * The if statement is the most simple decision-making statement. It is used to
     * decide whether a certain statement or block of statements will be executed or
     * not i.e. if a certain condition is true then a block of statements is
     * executed otherwise not.
     */

    // nested if

    // switch case
    /*
     * The switch statement is a multiway branch statement. It provides an easy way
     * to dispatch execution to different parts of code based on the value of the
     * expression.
     * 
     */
    /*
     * The expression can be of type byte, short, int char, or an enumeration.
     * Beginning with JDK7, the expression can also be of type String.
     * Duplicate case values are not allowed.
     * The default statement is optional.
     * The break statement is used inside the switch to terminate a statement
     * sequence.
     * The break statements are necessary without the break keyword, statements in
     * switch blocks fall through.
     * If the break keyword is omitted, execution will continue to the next case.

    // jump statements..............
    // .....................
    // Java supports three jump statements: break, continue and return. These three
    // statements transfer control to another part of the program.
    /*
     * Break: In Java, a break is majorly used for:
     * Terminate a sequence in a switch statement (discussed above).
     * To exit a loop.
     * Used as a “civilized” form of goto.
     */
    /*
     * Continue: Sometimes it is useful to force an early iteration of a loop. That
     * is, you might want to continue running the loop but stop processing the
     * remainder of the code in its body for this particular iteration. This is, in
     * effect, a goto just past the body of the loop, to the loop’s end. The
     * continue statement performs such an action.
     * 
     */
    /*
     * Return Statement
     * The return statement is used to explicitly return from a method. That is, it
     * causes program control to transfer back to the caller of the method.
