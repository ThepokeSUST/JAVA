          //Unary Operators
          //Unary Operators need only one operand. They are used to increment, decrement, or negate a value. 

          // Assignment Operator
        /*
          ‘=’ Assignment operator is used to assign a value to any variable. It has right-to-left associativity, i.e. value given on the right-hand side of the operator is assigned to the variable on the left, and therefore right-hand side value must be declared before using it or should be a constant.

          In many cases, the assignment operator can be combined with others to create shorthand compound statements. For example, a += 5 replaces a = a + 5. Common compound

          /*
            Relational Operators
Relational Operators are used to check for relations like equality, greater than, and less than. They return boolean results after the comparison and are extensively used in looping statements as well as conditional if-else statements.
